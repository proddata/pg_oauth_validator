# RPM dependency review, 2026-10-22

Status: **production approval blocked**. This is a review record, not a signed
release approval. Runtime tests and reproducible packages do not resolve vendor
security findings. No exception has been granted for the findings below.

## Reviewed inputs and evidence

The complete six-target inventory is retained as `packages.tsv`, `tools.txt`
and `image.json` with each builder archive. Verify their SHA-256 and sizes
against [`builders.lock.json`](../packaging/rpm/builders.lock.json) before
review. Inventory fields include exact epoch/version/release/architecture,
license, source RPM and vendor; do not compare only upstream version numbers.
Both architectures are required for Fedora 43, Fedora 44 and Rocky Linux 10.

The initial capture was workflow run
[39734560246](https://github.com/proddata/pg_oauth_validator/actions/runs/39734560246).
All six inventory hashes were independently checked against that lock. The
initial environment had these runtime package releases (architecture suffixes
are recorded separately in the inventories):

| Distribution | libcurl package | OpenSSL libraries | PostgreSQL server |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fedora 43 | `libcurl-8.15.0-12.fc43` | `1:3.5.9-1.fc43` | `18.6-1.fc43` |
| Fedora 44 | `libcurl-8.18.0-14.fc44` | `1:3.5.9-1.fc44` | `18.6-1.fc44` |
| Rocky 10 | `libcurl-minimal-8.12.1-4.el10_2.7` | `1:3.5.8-2.el10_2` | `18.6-4PGDG.rhel10.2` |

The initial capture is rejected for production. Installing build dependencies
left other inherited base packages behind available vendor security updates.
Online queries in separate disposable native ARM containers used
`dnf --refresh updateinfo list --security --updates`; no source, release files,
credentials or provider tokens were mounted. Fedora reported updates including
`FEDORA-2026-56e14eb520` (CA certificates, critical in vendor metadata),
`FEDORA-2026-72d10c874d` (libevent), tar, sudo and the curl command-line package.
Rocky reported available glibc, libevent and other inherited-package fixes.
These queries do not prove absence of vulnerabilities without published fixes.

The capture installer now applies `dnf upgrade --assumeyes --security` after
installing dependencies, with normal repository signature verification. This
happens before archiving the complete image. Offline consumers never execute
that installer or resolve mutable repositories. The refreshed capture
[39846491722](https://github.com/proddata/pg_oauth_validator/actions/runs/39846491722)
succeeded on all six native targets. All three small records for each target
were independently checked against the new lock's digests and sizes. Applying
updates to a running release builder is prohibited.

The refreshed lock SHA-256 is
`bd60616d04472bc2ab292efc4a75ce13f7c6c4c63d893ebab89e7a99233f1ad7`.
Both CPU inventories now record these corrected inherited dependencies:

| Distribution | CA certificates | glibc | libevent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fedora 43 | `2026.2.92_v9.0.319-2.fc43` | `2.42-17.fc43` | `2.1.13-1.fc43` |
| Fedora 44 | `2026.2.92_v9.0.319-1.fc44` | `2.43-9.fc44` | `2.1.13-1.fc44` |
| Rocky 10 | `2025.2.80_v9.0.305-102.el10` | `2.39-145.el10_2` | `2.1.13-1.el10_2` |

The direct libcurl, OpenSSL and PostgreSQL releases remain as listed above.
The lock is accepted for reproducibility/lifecycle testing, **not production
approval**. Rocky's OpenSSL finding remains open.

## Embedded libraries and licensing

The source pins are unchanged from v0.1.2:

| Library | Exact source commit | Archive SHA-256 | License |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jansson 2.15.1 | `dbb5fb3636e155fccfce4cd215de752779bd6971` | `65084e4e43de9840d66a0604c8d9d9c499b2fc0db52c05730e3b6ac3c11ed66f` | MIT, including dtoa notice |
| libjwt 3.3.3 | `602118d99d46ca5df71bda60d3df642135417f29` | `47e3d5d00fd60141dbacbcb9a0c2e1b277740364ac1d15b50728dccb7afdf23c` | MPL-2.0 |

The RPM gate checks complete license texts, the absence of private runtime
search paths and dynamic libjwt/Jansson dependencies, and complete corresponding
source archives in the SRPM. The package carries the existing third-party
notices and source locations. See
[`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). System shared libraries and
compiler/test tools are not incorporated into the validator RPM. Redistribution
of complete builder images also requires preserving the vendor license and
source-availability obligations recorded by the full package inventory; a
successful application-package license check is not approval of that separate
redistribution.

The two published libjwt advisories were checked: the pinned 3.3.3 includes the
fixes for [algorithm confusion](https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt/security/advisories/GHSA-q843-6q5f-w55g)
and [JWK NULL/bounds parsing](https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt/security/advisories/GHSA-ph96-hqpc-9f66).
Project envelope tests additionally reject HMAC algorithms. Jansson's
[maintainer advisory list](https://github.com/akheron/jansson/security/advisories)
had no published entries at query time; that is not a guarantee of safety.

## Runtime advisory dispositions

- PostgreSQL is 18.6 on every initial target. The upstream
  [18.6 security announcement](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-186-1711-1615-1519-1424-and-19-beta-3-released-3365/)
  and [major-18 security list](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/18/)
  remain the authority for supported server/client updates.
- Fedora OpenSSL 3.5.9 includes the upstream
  [September security fixes](https://openssl-library.org/news/openssl-3.5-notes/).
  Rocky 3.5.8-2 backports `CVE-2026-84782`, according to its installed RPM
  changelog, but does not record the `CVE-2026-35189` fix. The
  [upstream advisory](https://openssl-library.org/news/vulnerabilities-3.5/)
  describes certificate-processing memory exhaustion before 3.5.9; the
  [RHEL 10 tracker](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2026-35189)
  lists OpenSSL as affected. The fresh Rocky security-update query offered no
  OpenSSL fix. **Rocky production approval remains blocked** until a supported
  vendor fix is verified in the retained RPM/source patch set. Do not dismiss
  this certificate-processing path based on successful JWT or TLS unit tests.
- curl upstream version matching alone overstates some findings because Fedora
  and Rocky backport fixes. For example, Fedora's
  [8.18.0-14 changelog](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/curl/curl/fedora-44-updates.html)
  records OpenSSL-provider, pinning and HTTP/2 dependency fixes; the actual
  archived Fedora 43 and Rocky RPM changelogs were also inspected. Pending
  upstream reports still require explicit applicability review against the
  complete runtime closure before approval.
- In particular, [CVE-2026-92392](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2026-92392.html)
  requires an HTTP/2 upload. The validator uses bounded GET requests without
  uploads. [CVE-2026-92387](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2026-92387.html) concerns
  FTP/IMAP/POP3/SMTP control responses; the validator permits HTTP(S) only.
  These are application-path assessments, not assertions that the installed
  libcurl package is globally patched. Other software using the system library
  needs its own assessment.

The module's actual `ldd` closure was inspected locally. It includes libcurl,
OpenSSL, libc/libgcc and vendor transitive libraries; Fedora also loads HTTP/2,
HTTP/3, LDAP, SSH, Kerberos, compression and related dependencies. Linked does not
mean every protocol is enabled by this application. The full closure and all
remaining upstream/vendor advisories need final disposition against the
refreshed lock; there is no blanket waiver for unused features.

GitHub dependency, code-scanning and secret-scanning alert APIs returned no open
alerts on 2026-10-22. Secret values were not requested. New CI results and alert
status must be checked for the final candidate source revision.

## Approval requirements still open

The refreshed six-target capture and record verification are complete. Inspect
the retained security-update transactions and finish vendor/upstream applicability
review against those exact versions.
Resolve Rocky OpenSSL and every other applicable unpatched runtime finding,
complete the transitive dependency/license review, retain approved inputs and
package/evidence bundles durably before CI expiry, and rerun the retained real
version upgrade/rollback matrix on that exact lock. No RPM is tagged, signed or
published by this work.
